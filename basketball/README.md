# Basketball Project
This project is a summary of my family's NCAA March Madness Tournament history
with tools for analyzing team data and tournament history. The application contains

* All-time standings for the family tournament
* A list of statistics for tournament winners since 2006
* Pages for each NCAA team with statistics since 2006
* A page for each tournament since 2006 with bracket picks for each family member,
the true results, the final standings, and a graph of the distribution of teams
by conference
* A page that allows the user to look at graphs that depict trends over time such
as winning percentage based on seed, conference, or ELO Rating (chess-based rating system)
