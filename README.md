# My Projects

This repository contains the code for my
[personal website](https://smeds.herokuapp.com/), which consists of projects
that I have undertaken to practice my data analysis and web development skills.
The projects are as follows:

### Basketball Project
This project is a summary of my family's NCAA March Madness Tournament history
with tools for analyzing team data and tournament history. The application contains

* A record of every tournament game since 2006
* Tournament history for each team
* ELO ratings (chess rating system) for every team for each season since 2006
* Graphs of aggregate tournament data

### Education Project
This project is a look at the high school graduation rates for the 2015-2016
school year. This application contains

* A record of graduation rates in each US state and population distribution among
various demographics
* Graduation rates by demographic
* Choropleth heat maps for easy comparison of populations and rates between US
states
